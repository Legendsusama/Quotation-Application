# Quotation Application

Hi friends! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Quotation Application project. This simple web application is designed to provide you with new and inspiring quotes at the click of a button. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/) to fetch quotes.

## Features

- **New Quote Button:** Click the "New Quote" button to get a fresh and inspiring quotation.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop.

## How It Works

The application fetches quotes from the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/) when the "New Quote" button is clicked. You can explore the API to understand its capabilities and customize the application according to your needs.
